For the Excersise have used Spring Boot with Mongo DB as a Cache.
You should create a Mongo Database called images.
I have added Swagger as well http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

I couldn't finish the excercise as I wanted.
The solution needs:
- Unit Tests.
- Better error Handling. (I have added //TODOS in the code)
- Request validations. (I have added some //TODOS in the Code)
